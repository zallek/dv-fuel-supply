## About The Project

Fuel Supply is a Derail Valley mod that enhances the game's realism by implementing a dynamic fuel supply chain system:

- Dynamic diesel pricing that fluctuates based on market supply and demand
- Regional price variations where remote stations charge higher rates due to transportation costs
- Limited fuel availability at stations that can deplete over time
- Fuel resupply mechanics by completing fuel tanker wagons missions
