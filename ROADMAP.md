# Roadmap

1. [ ] Change diesel price to a constant value
2. [ ] Change diesel price according to the station (ie, define a base price by station)
3. [ ] Price fluctuations overtime (kinda random)
4. [ ] Diesel capacity
    - Display capacity on pit stop
    - Refueling lowers capacity
5. [ ] Refill missions to increase capacity
5. [ ] Price varies according to local supply
